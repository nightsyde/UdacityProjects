# UdacityProjects

## Overview
Repository for archiving my projects after review. Projects fall into one of two categories: 1) archived after final review; 2) working versions while previous project is still under review. Once the "active project" in Active Repository has been reviewed and accepted, the "active" will be archived, the buffer emptied, and working copy will be moved to the Active Repository
